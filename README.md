         - sample task image :- https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5abf57be-0e50-4595-a2c9-ab55d9e21adf
         - sample task explnation:
              User Context Input: "Check the image size."
              AI-Generated Task Output:
                 Title: Frontend Task
                 Description: Auto-created task (Context: Check the image size.)
                 Category: Frontend
                 Priority: Medium
                 Suggested Deadline: 2025-07-09 (i.e., 1 day from the task creation date)
               Explanation:
                 The keyword "image" suggests a user interface or visual concern, leading the AI to classify it under the Frontend category.The phrase implies moderate urgency, prompting the AI to assign a Medium priority.Based                          on the priority level, the AI calculates an appropriate deadline using predefined rules (e.g., Medium priority → 1-day deadline).
