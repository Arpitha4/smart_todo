         3. Explanation:
            The keyword "image" suggests a user interface or visual concern, leading the AI to classify it under the Frontend category.The phrase implies moderate urgency, prompting the AI to assign a Medium priority.Based on the priority level, the AI calculates an appropriate deadline using predefined rules (e.g., Medium priority → 1-day deadline).
